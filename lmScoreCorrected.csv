"Besides tags into human body , there is also the issue of implant into products .

",51.31446838378906,3160388.75,0
"So , in the following , I will clarify these two different views for rising life expectancies .
",107.63462829589844,2814757.25,0
"For the first part , rising life expectancies is a challenge .
",99.3140106201172,531032.75,0
"We should image that when the life expectancies are raised up ; this will mean that the average age for the population in nation wise or globally is also rising .

"The number of the older people will increase to make the average life expectancies higher .
",46.74691390991211,5905.99658203125,0
"For these older people , the society need man power and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them .

"Sometimes , older need more man power and resources than normal young people .

"However , these older people usually contribute less or nearly have no productivity for the society .

"So the dilemma takes place when there are more people who have a higher age .
",55.02899169921875,18930.62890625,0

"This is the interpretation of challenge for rising life expectancies .

"For the second part , rising life expectancies is also an achievement .
",92.85231018066406,338710.375,0
"The achievement is some kind of a comparison with the history in the past .
",62.07614135742188,32892.47265625,0
"In the ancient time , due to the less development of science and technology , people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care for their healthy .

"Hence people died of various diseases .
",145.2667694091797,3806.5048828125,0
"On the other hand , there are not sufficient materials or ways to improve people 's daily life .
",38.29566955566406,2413.960205078125,0
"People do not know how to protect their tooth from becoming decayed tooth .

"These small things makes the quality of people 's life less enjoyable than today .
",172.39007568359375,39938.98046875,0
"Bad mood can not give them a longer time of life .
",102.68482208251952,10624.8642578125,0
"Due to all these reasons , people died quite early , which results in a low life expectancy .
",38.30397033691406,3337.190185546875,0

"In that sense , rising life expectancies can be considered as an achievement .
