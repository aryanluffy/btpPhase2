    "No matter how good and how many security systems are there for us , the hackers are also increasingly improving their skills in terms of hacking and breaking the codes of the security system .\n": 0,
    "On the other hand , I think RFID can be useful when comes to appropriate handling and usage .\n": 0,
    "For example , this can be a very beneficial and useful device for police force to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements , or contributing to more leads for solving a case .\n": 0,

    "This from also can be used as a tracking device where the places a person visited for the past few trips were all recorded by the system and the cards .\n": 0,
    "This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to the society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order .\n": 0,
    "As this information is been well keep by the operators where they encrypt the data and used it in the proper form .\n": 0,
    "This also prevents the chances of normal hackers to get this information that were recorded for proper usages are misused for unlawful usages .\n": 0,
    "Moreover , the use of the RFID for medical research is also been widely used in many countries .\n": 0,
    "These chips were also implanted under the human skin where it also helps to store the basic information of the person in it .\n": 0,
    "This form of tools does not harm but it helps in the ability to identify any person who is not carrying any identification when comes to emergency .\n": 0,

    "By investigating the track by the surveillance technology , they can easily figure out where are their kids now and know roughly what they are doing .\n": 0,
    "On the other hand , due to the track of people , the police can better know a person 's daily schedule .\n": 0,
    "It gives the police a better control of the criminal .\n": 0,
    "All these contributions by using the surveillance technology to track make the environment safer .\n": 0,
    "Tracking people using surveillance technology can make people 's life more convenient and identifiable .\n": 0,
    "Nowadays , people need to carry a lot of ID cards around to show that I am the one the same as the one on the ID cards .\n": 0,
    "If we have these technologies , it will automatically confirm people 's indemnification and save the effort to carry a lot of cards .\n": 0,
    "Once people have their own identity confirmed , they can even need not to bring any money along with them .\n": 0,
    "To purchase goods , they just need to deduce money from their identity and make a transition of money to the one who is selling the goods .\n": 0,
    "Based on the identifiable environment , a lot of convention way or style of human life can be changed .\n": 0,
    "For the privacy concern , if the technology can be made to adjust to human being 's feeling , it will be more welcomed .\n": 0,
    "For example , if the one who carry the identifiable sensor does not want any other to know his or her location , he or she can disable the track .\n": 0,
    "Then , you may ask , how can the police get the information ?\n": 1,
    "I think that the track can be saved in some place which is not open to public .\n": 0,
    "Once it is very severe , the records will be pop out for official use .\n": 0,

    "In short , it can provide a safe , convenient , identifiable environment for human beings .\n": 0,
    "Besides , we can try to reduce the bad effect cause by the new technology .\n": 0,
    "Thus , I strongly agree that surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) can be used to track people .\n": 1,
    "I do not agree with the above statement .\n": 1,
    "In my opinion , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people though there do exist many problems if it prevails .\n": 0,
    "This can help to regulate people 's behavior , control crime and prevent terrorism , and set up demographic data .\n": 0,
    "RFID , despite the fact that it may be considered as privacy infringement , is different from video surveillance .\n": 1,
    "Unlike video surveillance , RIFD can only reflect the location and movements of the person with tags .\n": 1,
    "Without sending back any images or sound record , RFID is more user-friendly and helps prevent user 's privacy at the best it can .\n": 0,
    "Firstly , RFID is a useful tool to help to regulate human or animal behavior .\n": 1,
    "The tags can be used on those who need to be took care or the beloved ones , such as a child whose parents are always concerning about his whereabouts when parents are not together with him , or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to lost her .\n": 0,
    "In the first case , RFID can be used to help parents to surveillance their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at his friends ' home , and this may help parents regulate their children 's behavior .\n": 0,
    "Secondly , RFID can be used to control crime and prevent terrorism .\n": 1,
    "Everyday crimes are happening from time to time , and help to keep low criminal rate can be a combo of ethical , physiological and social problems .\n": 0,
    "RFID can be one of the trivial ways to help dispel criminal or terroristic thoughts .\n": 0,
    "Police can put tags on those that have potential intention to commit crime .\n": 0,
    "Thus , when a man with a 'terrorism tag ' entering a junction or a plaza full of people police should notice this and observe the man 's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from explode TNT .\n": 0,
    "Apart from preventing crime and terrorism , RFID can also be used as an evidence or alibi to help infer whether the suspect is the criminal or not .\n": 0,
    "What is more , RFID can be used to help collect demographic data .\n": 0,
    "If RFID is used on everyone and running for years , surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistic data showing the movement of people from city to city , from town to town , which city is expanding more than people thought , which city is becoming less attractive .\n": 0,
    "Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructures , what kind of infrastructures and what other development should be made .\n": 0,
    "Economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend of local as well as the whole country .\n": 0,
    "As for transportation , roads and traffic authority can easily identify where traffic jams are and advise drivers to change to suggested routes .\n": 0,
    "In all , RFID should be applied to facilitate governors to better manage the world that we are living .\n": 0,
    "It can help regulate behaviors , prevent crime and set up demographic data base for various uses .\n": 0,
    "But before the application , governments need to secure safety of RFID after implantation and make sure there will not be any ID theft .\n": 0,
    "More importantly , governments should make sure only the right people can get access to these data and they must guarantee that they will not misuse or abuse the information .\n": 1,
    "As technology becomes more advanced nowadays , people are very exposed to the various types of technology in their daily lives .\n": 0,
    "It is undeniable that technology has made ours lives and works easier and more efficient .\n": 0,
    "However , when surveillance technology starts to violet the privacy of people instead of being used in a more benefitial way towards people , it is my opinion , that , such technology should rethink its way of existence .\n": 0,
    "In fact , people are getting more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual world-the internet .\n": 0,
    "Social networks such as facebook ,Tiwtter and many others often reveal the true identities and some confidential information of the users without being realised .\n": 0,
    "This already raises up a problem of privacy leakage .\n": 0,
    "The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by stalking on people 's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people .\n": 0,
    "Such incident happened in London a few years ago , when the government installed CCTV ( ) on several streets in order to better supervise its people to keep the social order .\n": 0,
    "This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searching on people who violated the law and caused harm to others .\n": 0,
    "Instead , when news of the installment of such device was released on the newspaper , it was heavily cricised by the public .\n": 0,
    "People were claiming the lost of privacy .\n": 0,
    "Government had to uninstall all the devices in the end .\n": 0,
    "From this case , we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some way , however , when it touches the privacy of people themselves , it is unacceptable .\n": 0,
    "From the point of humanity , it is inhumane to use such technology on human beings .\n": 0,
    "We often put tags on products and animals because we treat them as goods , it is easy for trade when they are all labelled and tagged .\n": 0,
    "However , human beings are not animals or any other products , they have their own thoughts and freedom .\n": 0,
    "They have a full control of their own lives .\n": 0,
    "If so , then why do we need human implants to trace their activities and lives when they are free to do things that they like .\n": 0,
    "It is understandable that once people have human implants , they may start to behave themselves because they can be easily traced out .\n": 0,
    "However , this way of curbing the crimes is so violent that will only cause people to rebel and think of ways to escape the track of such device .\n": 0,
    "Afterall there will be an endless battle between the technology and human mentality .\n": 0,
    "Humanity can be best seen in the case of pets rearing .\n": 0,
    "Pets are supposed to be chained when they are out on the streets .\n": 0,
    "However , in countries like China , where there is no law to force people to chain their pets , pets are usually left unchained and run freely on the streets .\n": 0,
    "It may be dangerous as some pets are rather fierce and aggressive , however , it is the benevolence nature of human beings that we treat pets as \" human beings \" , our friends that we do not want to restrict their freedom .\n": 0,
    "This phenomenon is accepted by the public even by those who do not own a pet .\n": 0,
    "This shows that even though there is a risk of causing harms to someone , people still prefers to bear the risk and allow their pets to have maximum freedom .\n": 0,
    "Even pets are granted with freedom , people themselves certainly treat freedom as something essential .\n": 0,
    "In conclusion , I think that surveilence technology should not be allowed to be used to track people .\n": 0,
    "it does not only restrict their freedom in all aspects , but also cause leakage of personal information .\n": 0,
    "This greatly violets the rights of people .\n": 0,

    "Example of this technology is RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implants or RFID tags on people .\n": 0,
    "However , this proposal has led to fierce argument in the world over its pros and cons .\n": 1,
    "I personally stand together with the population who reject the proposal .\n": 0,
    "First of all , everyone in the world belongs to themselves who does not belong to anyone from my personal perspective .\n": 0,
    "Human rights were raised up pretty frequently in the world over the past few years .\n": 0,
    "Approval of RFID tracking will be seen as a violation of human rights and people will lose their most basic freedom .\n": 0,
    "Would not it similar to criminals in prison but in a bigger confined space ?\n": 0,
    "Secondly , the tracking proposal will raise a safety issue .\n": 1,
    "The chip identifier technology can be reproduced by anyone .\n": 1,
    "It represents a query : is not everyone can view each other 's information such as name and age ?\n": 0,
    "The leakage of these confidential information can be a sensitive issue to personal , violation of freedom and breakdown of safety .\n": 0,
    "One of the examples is the storage of bank account number in the tracking chip .\n": 0,
    "Criminal could identify it easily by getting a small identifier anywhere and everywhere if the tracking proposal is approved .\n": 0,
    "He or she could easily touch on the designated bank account since password cracking is an easy task for most hackers .\n": 0,
    "Other than that , safety issue can be extended to personal safety .\n": 0,
    "Everyone knows the internet and data transmission are very common and accessible at any time and point such as Facebook .\n": 0,
    "However , people tend to express their personal feeling and idea about sensitive issues on the internet unintentionally .\n": 0,
    "This action could actually generate aggressive feeling from others and violent movement could be launched onto the one with the aid of tracking tag or implant .\n": 0,
    "Internet can be a convenient source to achieve the name and basic information of personal if it is hacked and the tracking proposal will facilitate the finding of designated person .\n": 0,
    "In addition , the national defense will be endangered if this tracking proposal is launched .\n": 0,
    "The technology is based on the chip implant or tag .\n": 1,
    "However , the chip implant can be retrieved out easily and replanted onto other people and so on the tag .\n": 0,
    "Mischief cases could actually cause a chaos on the checkpoint tracking record and a more serious issue if people do it ill-intentionally .\n": 0,
    "For example , a wanted person can escape out easily from a country and hide in another country with this method .\n": 1,
    "This tracking proposal creates a loophole in the net of justice rather than its original purpose .\n": 0,
    "In a nutshell , surveillance technology may provide a lot of convenience if being used appropriately .\n": 0,
    "However , it is fairly fragile which can be counter-used by criminals at current level .\n": 0,
    "I would stand against the idea of tracking individuals given its vulnerabilities of technology at present .\n": 0,
    "Nowadays , the improved human technology online is able to track different location for different people .\n": 0,

    "Thus , let 's us discuss the pros and cons now to give you a clearer minds of surveillance technology .\n": 0,
    "Initially , surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) is implanted into the body of animals .\n": 0,
    "It functions to track the path of animals and help in scientific research .\n": 0,
    "Besides that , many animals which just be released from the protection of human for a long time are implanted the RFID as well to track their new life to ensure whether they could survive in the wild life .\n": 0,
    "This technology are encouraged by some of the public that to implant the RFID into prisoners ' body .\n": 0,
    "The initial function is good indeed that to track the movement of them to protect the public safety and interest if they are out of prison .\n": 0,
    "However , some of the non-governmental organizations show their point of view that object and resist implanting the RFID into prisoners ' body .\n": 0,
    "Their opinions are founded on the basic human rights .\n": 0,
    "Prisoners ' privacy is endangered due to the RFID .\n": 0,
    "After they release from the prison , the movement of their whole life is controlled and known by the government .\n": 0,
    "They feel stressful under the control of government and it may lead to the ways that we do not desire and imagine .\n": 0,
    "Furthermore , some of parents hold the positive views to surveillance technology and agree to implant the RFID into their children 's body .\n": 0,
    "Their opinion is based on the children safety protection and parents ' guardian .\n": 0,
    "Children can be easily found if they are lost or abducted by other people .\n": 0,
    "However , there are both sides of stories .\n": 0,
    "This technology leads to a problem which is same with the prisoner issue that is the human privacy .\n": 0,
    "Children are given birth by their parents ; parents are responsible to take good care of them .\n": 0,
    "Although the initial function of implementation of RFID is good for the children , however children also have the human rights and privacy which is endanger under this technology .\n": 0,
    "Besides tags into human body , there is also the issue of implant into products .\n": 0,
    "Recently , many of cell phone are equipped with GPS which means that they can find the device 's location if it is lost .\n": 0,
    "It is also the advance of surveillance technology .\n": 0,
    "Children can easily be track based on the location of cell phone by parents .\n": 0,
    "Compared to the human implant , tags on the products is better and more suitable .\n": 0,
    "Under the products tags , children are given a significant free space as compared to the congested control by human implant .\n": 0,
    "Parents also can ensure the safety of children as well as do not endanger their privacy .\n": 0,
    "It is the ways that can \" using one stone to kill two birds \" .\n": 0,
    "In conclusion , based on the advantages and disadvantages discussed , I agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .\n": 1,
    "However , to a certain extent , I agree to implant RFID tags on products to protect the safety of children .\n": 0,
    "As world pace becomes faster and faster , the need for maximum efficiency becomes stronger and stronger in every field .\n": 0,
    "To know where a certain item locates becomes one of the ways to improve efficiency .\n": 0,
    "For example , UPS can track the process of each delivery .\n": 0,
    "With the information about the location of the cargo , it is much easier to prevent unexpected loss and come up with more efficient plans to save the energy and resources of the company .\n": 0,
    "RFID is one of the advanced technology for tracking .\n": 0,
    "Due to the small size of the equipment and the energy-saving feature , it becomes more and more popular in industries and logistics .\n": 0,
    "However , it is not a reasonable idea to use RFID to track people by human implants or RFID tags on daily products like watch or clothes , it did provide convenience in a certain situation .\n": 0,
    "The biggest difference between human and animals or any other objects is that we have self-esteem or we need the basic respect from our peer .\n": 0,
    "One of the basic rights of human is the right for privacy .\n": 0,
    "In any period of time , as long as we do not offense others , we should enjoy the right of privacy .\n": 0,
    "However , the idea of using RFID to track people violates our need for privacy .\n": 0,
    "Since RFID tags attached to the product can remain functional for a long period of time , it could be misused for surveillance purposed which are not related to the industries production or supply activities .\n": 0,
    "For example , a consumer buys a product with RFID from a supermarket .\n": 1,
    "As the RFID is embedded within the product , people who have the access to the information definitely can track him .\n": 1,
    "However , the consumer may not be aware of the function of the tag , so this action could reveal the sensitive information of the consumers like home address , working address to someone who is not authorized to get the information .\n": 0,
    "If this piece of information is misused , chances are high that the consumer would suffer loss like financial loss or even cause danger to the life of the consumer .\n": 0,
    "Moreover , if the product is what one needs to use every day like clothes or shoes , then the location of one will be revealed every seconds .\n": 0,
    "This is just like there is an invisible stalker behind you .\n": 1,
    "It is not only scary but also illegal .\n": 1,
    "Although someone would say the information is secured very well and will not be released or misused by any purpose , it is still not appropriate .\n": 0,
    "We can think about this scenario : the location of us going on daily life will be sent to a computer to be processed and stored every second .\n": 0,
    "Does this sound reasonable to you ?\n": 1,
    "As what we have mentioned above , as human being , we should enjoy our privacy during our life as long as we do not cause harm to others .\n": 0,
    "However , RFID will violate our right of privacy during our shopping activities .\n": 0,
    "Therefore , RFID should not be used to track people no matter through human implants or tags on products .\n": 0,
    "Does the society need surveillance or not ?\n": 0,
    "With the developing of modern society , more and more new technology appears and people 's life qualities rise because of the new inventions .\n": 0,
    "Some good examples such as the Internet , computers and satellites are now quite common for humans ' normal life ; however , some problems also emerge , with a concern of the loss of the privacy of civilians .\n": 0,
    "In the modern society privacy is a hot topic in peoples ' mind .\n": 0,
    "Even if the safety is the most important thing to consider in normal life , many people still want to keep their privacy in spite of existing some potential danger .\n": 0,
    "The contradiction of the safety and the privacy can not be reconciled perfectly .\n": 0,
    "With the installing of the surveillances for every corner of Singapore , people 's life has a safe security , and criminals are deterred by these electrical instruments .\n": 0,
    "A report shows that the crime rate in Singapore is the lowest in the world .\n": 1,
    "This is because of two reasons , one is the strict law in Singapore , and the other is the dense surveillances everywhere .\n": 0,
    "During the year 2003 , surveillance strategies helped Singapore beat the SARS and successfully prevented the spreading of the epidemic situation .\n": 0,

    "Much media has reported the effective measures of installing the surveillances in Singapore .\n": 0,
    "Without the using of the surveillance , the epidemic situation could not be controlled strictly , and the loss caused by SARS might be many times than that in 2003 in Singapore .\n": 0,
    "The benefits of the surveillance are obvious in the fighting of SARS , and this is a success example of the surveillance .\n": 0,
    "Every coin has its two sides .\n": 0,
    "In one way the surveillance help government guard civilians ' property and life , in the other way the surveillance makes people feel uncomfortable under the 24 hours ' monitoring .\n": 0,
    "In the novel 1984 , written by George Orwell , author imagines a world in which people are being watched by the big brother when they doing everything .\n": 0,
    "Every words people say can be heard by the government and because of that , government know well about everyone 's mind and want to wash everyone 's mind and control normal people totally .\n": 0,

    "Normal people 's privacy needs government seriously considered about .\n": 0,
    "People needs a safe environment to live in , and also needs a private environment to stay independent .\n": 0,
    "The surveillance is a useful method to keep society 's safe , but also kills the privacy of people in some degree .\n": 0,
    "The best way to solve the contradiction is to educate people well and make them live an affluent life , and then the surveillance is no more needed .\n": 0,
    "At that time , even if there is no surveillance above people 's heads , there are surveillances in everyone 's heart and criminals are more difficult to hide .\n": 0,
    "Nowadays , humans live in a modern society .\n": 1,
    "Around people , there are full of high technology like CCTVs , automatically sorting system for goods and different information systems .\n": 0,
    "In order to bring more benefit and ensure people 's safety , surveillance technology has been utilized in many aspects of fields like in UPs and DHL , these express delivery companies use surveillance technology to track their goods .\n": 0,
    "It is convenient for customs to track and confirm where and how their goods are now .\n": 0,
    "However , besides tracking goods for people , people begin to use this technology to track people .\n": 0,
    "I do not agree this kind of behavior , because humans are different from goods , can not treat humans as goods .\n": 0,
    "There is no a doubt , tracking system has brought many benefits in this information age .\n": 0,
    "No matter where people go , taking bus or MRT , people are under the CCTVs , it is very important and useful to track and find people .\n": 0,
    "Actually , tracking system has provided people safety indemnification .\n": 0,
    "However , tracking people are difficult and different from goods .\n": 0,
    "For instance , a company has over two hundred employees scattered over different locations in Singapore , and is currently keeping tracking of working hours and overtime payments through the use of a punch card system-a system which can be open to abuses such as an employee punching the card for another .\n": 0,
    "Goods are dead , but humans are alive .\n": 1,
    "If one company really uses this technology to track their employees , employees will dislike and claim that their humans ' right and privacy have been violated .\n": 0,
    "In another a word , people will feel that the boss or the company treats them like goods , because modern people need more homage not money .\n": 0,
    "So , when employees begin to conflict with this tracking system , they will find some ways to escape the tracking system like asking friends to help them to punch the cards .\n": 0,
    "Finally , the company tracking system has no meaning at all , therefore tracking system is very terrible measure to control people .\n": 0,
    "In addition , tracking people system may be used by bad people in a wrong way .\n": 0,
    "How to explain this problem , it means that people are not sure who are in charge of these tracking system .\n": 0,
    "For example , people go somewhere , no matter taking bus , MRT or driving , they are under the CCTVs .\n": 0,
    "If some bad people want to track someone for their personal purposes , by hacker technology , they can use government tracking system to do their own business .\n": 0,
    "In other words , government originally hopes to use tracking system to ensure citizens safety , now it has been divulged human information .\n": 0,
    "It is very dangerous for society , because people do not know who are tracking them , it must bring citizens trepidation .\n": 0,
    "In conclusion , what I have mentioned above , we have to agree , tracking system has many benefits in different parts in humans life especially in this modern world .\n": 0,
    "But tracking people is very terrible choice , it sounds like people invented a 'prison ' to jail themselves , people need homage and freedom .\n": 0,

    "From the view of my point , I think the application should only be authorized by people in some specific fields like politics and public security .\n": 1,
    "Firstly , privacy will not be protected if everything is under monitoring .\n": 0,
    "We can not imagine our every move is under track and there may be someone who is staring at you from some place through the monitor .\n": 0,
    "That sounds like we are naked in front of the public , there is no secret and even privacy for us .\n": 0,
    "Perhaps that the surveillance is installed for the sake of safety , but actually it conversely make us have a lack of safety .\n": 0,
    "Therefore , the surveillance technology can not be casually used .\n": 0,

    "There is no denying that every coin has two sides .\n": 1,
    "The technology also applies .\n": 0,
    "On one side , we can use it to ensure that something is under our control to reduce the rate of crimes .\n": 0,
    "On the other side , the technology can also be probably used by the lawbreader to commit crimes .\n": 0,
    "And once this happens , privacy does not exist any more and people 's life is under great threaten .\n": 0,
    "Therefore , this technology carries great risk when we can only see the advantages that has been appeared .\n": 0,

    "However , if nothing happened inside his house , then the surveillance becomes useless , and he will also feel very uncomfortable because his every move is being supervised .\n": 0,
    "Therefore , for ordinary people , there is no need for them to use this technology .\n": 1,
    "Otherwise , it is just a waste of resources .\n": 1,
    "From the reasons above , we can see that the surveillance technology takes great danger with it so that we can not apply it to our daily life .\n": 0,
    "However , we can take the essence and reject its dross .\n": 0,
    "That is to say , we can use it in some specific and special areas such as public security and politics .\n": 1,
    "These fields are special because of the job category , and the need to be open to the public , so the disadvantages will not be shown .\n": 0,
    "Contrarily , it can help to supervise the public figures in politics and track the offenders in security .\n": 0,
    "Therefore , the surveillance technology should not be used except for some specific jobs .\n": 0,
    "Surveillance technology such as Radio-Frequency Identification ( RFID ) to track the population is potentially is dangerous weapon by the governments against its own people .\n": 0,
    "It should therefore not be used to track the population in order to protect people 's privacy and the idea of democracy .\n": 1,
    "Using surveillance technology such as Radio-Frequency Identification ( RFID ) to track the population can be seen as merely progression from older technologies such as the identification cards .\n": 0,
    "A possible benefit is better statistical analysis , which will provide the government with more information when drafting policies .\n": 1,

    "Although that method may invade certain people 's right and privacy , but in exchange for that we can get a safe and peaceful society .\n": 0,
    "If the surveillance technology is abandoned , it makes the police very difficult to track the suspicious people and can have little control of those people who are dangerous to the society .\n": 0,
    "For example , without surveillance technology , the murders can escape much more easily since no one knows their position .\n": 0,
    "Without surveillance technology , the suspicious people might actually commit a murder and the murder can be much more serious if the police can not arrive in time to help out .\n": 0,
    "On the other hand , the application of surveillance technology serves as a warning to the murders and they might not commit more murder since they might be afraid of being tracked by the police .\n": 0,
    "If that technology is abandoned , it may trigger more bad people to commit murder or stole things since it is very difficult for the police to track them and they have a high possibility of not being punished by the law .\n": 0,
    "Therefore , the continuation of using surveillance technology is really necessary .\n": 1,
    "Although surveillance technology should not be totally abandoned , regulations of using that is expected .\n": 0,
    "With the popularization of surveillance technology , a more concise and more complete regulations of using that is highly needed .\n": 0,

    "With the development of surveillance technology such as RFID , spy on the population can be much easier , which will create even worse scenery for the citizens .\n": 0,
    "In this paper , the incorrectness of using technology such as RFID to track people will be proved by the discussion of violation of privacy , the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the authority .\n": 0,
    "First , the violation of privacy will be dramatically increased .\n": 0,
    "Typically , the RFID tags are small devices with a read-only chip .\n": 0,
    "The regular distance of data exchange can be several meters .\n": 0,
    "Once such chip is loaded with personal information and implants in individuals , all the information about his or her life can be recorded .\n": 0,
    "Some supporters may argue that it will more convenient to use RFID for identification in place like airport and check point .\n": 0,
    "However , the fact is that such technology will create check points everywhere .\n": 0,
    "Furthermore , such tracking on individuals is done without permission of the subject person .\n": 0,
    "That is to say , people will be surveilled for every moment without awareness .\n": 0,
    "In such situation , individuals will lose their basic privacy .\n": 0,
    "Second , when technology like RFID is widely used , there will be a trend to misuse such technology .\n": 1,
    "An important feature of RFID is the minimal security .\n": 1,
    "Since it is read-only , the card can not protect itself .\n": 1,
    "Moreover , almost every one can gain access to the card reader as the reader requires only simple technology .\n": 1,
    "Then , if a business man wants to defeat his competitor , he can just buy a reader and spy for commercial secrets .\n": 0,
    "Hence , once RFID is widely used , people are very likely to spy on each other , which will destroy trust , respect and many moral values .\n": 1,
    "Third , to use the surveillance technology will enhance the totalitarian power of the authority .\n": 0,
    "The government is supposed to serve the people .\n": 1,
    "However , once the government gathers too much power , the democracy may be turned into totalitarianism , and such surveillance technology provides the measures .\n": 0,
    "Spying and collecting excessive information of individuals is the first step .\n": 0,
    "When government is able to find out all the precise information about its citizens , it can gradually apply control over them .\n": 0,
    "Consequently , the government is very likely to turn to be a totalitarian authority , which will be the worst scenery and tragedy for every single citizen .\n": 0,
    "All in all , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track general population for the violation of privacy , the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power of the authority .\n": 0,
    "Privacy must be respected , and power over other should be controlled .\n": 0,

    "Some people think RFID should be banned out of privacy consideration .\n": 0,
    "However , As far as I am concerned , using RFID to track specific people can be very helpful in situations such as scientific exploration , rescue and police events .\n": 0,
    "During scientific exploration , especially the geographical ones , the tracking is very important .\n": 0,
    "This tracking will help scientists to better get their result and clear exploration route information will also be useful for post-research when scientists come back .\n": 0,
    "In addition , people who research in biodiversity will also need to be tracked .\n": 1,
    "When these scholars are on the field journey , they also have to relate their observation with their route information ; this is when RFID is of great significance .\n": 0,
    "In addition , field journeys are sometimes very dangerous .\n": 1,
    "Observers are likely to go into the rural forests or mountainous areas .\n": 1,
    "Their safety may face huge challenge .\n": 0,
    "For this kind of situation , RFID will help a lot .\n": 0,
    "Actually , not only for scientific observations but also during adventure journeys or travelling , RFID can defend human beings from harm .\n": 0,
    "Firstly , knowing where the travelers are and may going can assist them to know what the surroundings will be like and they can prepare better to protect themselves or they can change directions to avoid the potential danger .\n": 0,
    "Furthermore , by telling the geographical position of the people , RFID can accelerate the rescue process and will improve the survival rate of the victims .\n": 0,
    "During the rescue , every second is valuable !\n": 0,
    "RFID is also functional in police events .\n": 0,
    "By getting the track of the suspensors , police officers can decide who the criminal exactly is sooner and easier to gain the truth behind the criminal event .\n": 0,
    "Furthermore , knowing where the criminal is will also simplify the chasing process .\n": 1,
    "Policeman can just go to the certain place and chase the criminal .\n": 0,
    "Besides , tracking people with potential danger will be helpful for the safety department to predict the harm and better avoid the problem .\n": 0,
    "Some people may argue that using RFID to track people will leave out individuals ' privacy .\n": 0,
    "Nevertheless , the activities I mentioned above are related little to privacy issues .\n": 0,
    "Firstly , for scientific exploration , rescue and police events , the privacy factors are far less important than the individual or social safety and scientific results .\n": 0,
    "In addition , for observation journeys and traveling , we only need to use RFID on some certain individuals and they will agree with this action for their own benefit .\n": 0,
    "Above all , I think we can not ban the use of RFID completely , since it will be of great help for human 's benefit during scientific exploration , rescue and police events .\n": 0,
    "By using this technology reasonably , it will assist people to walk faster and further in the long and rough civilization developing path .\n": 0,

    "Personally , I think surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) should not be used to track people , for the benefit it brings to me can not match the concerns it causes .\n": 1,
    "It has been quite a long time since someone raises the importance of the right of privacy .\n": 0,
    "Without doubt , surveillance technology is going against the right since it leaks out people 's information without getting their permission .\n": 0,
    "When the technology is not so well developed , it may not be a big problem for leaking limited information .\n": 1,
    "While as it becomes highly developed , it is very scary to realize that this technology actually tells lots of people where did you go and what did you do .\n": 0,
    "It gives you the feeling that all people are watching a movie , and you are the hero whose every movement including using the toilet is under others observation , just like what was showed in the movie The Truman Show which chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed world , broadcast to billions of people .\n": 0,
    "When I have such feelings , I will feel that I am not belongs to human beings as everyone else any longer , instead , I am like a pet or a tool to be made fun of by others .\n": 0,
    "It is more like a prisoner 's life , because we are under other people 's control and we can do nothing to change our situation .\n": 0,
    "On the other hand , when we allow surveillance technology being used to track people , it increases the successful rate of people taking bad actions .\n": 0,

    "This shows the rising of life expectancies , it is an achievement and it is also a challenge .\n": 0,
    "The rising life expectancies may be due to several different reasons , for example , it may be because of the improvement of the living condition , or because of the upgrade of the cleanness of the living environment , or because of the wide arrange of nutrition that absorbed by the human , or because of the development of the medication system in the country .\n": 0,

    "For developing countries , they may encounter more about the shortage of food resources and and the problem of how to develop better medication system to serve the entire nation , and they also face the problem of how to distribute the wealth evenly to benefit the entire population , more over they need to consider carefully how to build the education system so that the next generation of the population will be able to carry on to raise the whole country .\n": 0,
    "For developed countries , the challenge they face mainly are the over crowded modern cities usually face the public transportation problem and also the unevenly distributed wealth which result in that some of the population unable to benefit from the development of the human society in terms of technology which improve the life quality .\n": 0,

    "In another words , it indicates that the national healthcare system is effective , well-managed by the Government .\n": 0,
    "This gives credits to the Government 's medical and healthcare schemes .\n": 0,

    "Rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement .\n": 0,
    "We should separate it into two aspects .\n": 1,
    "The first one is that rising life expectancies can be considered as a challenge .\n": 0,
    "The second one is that rising life expectancies can also be considered an achievement .\n": 0,
    "They are not contradicting with each other .\n": 0,
    "In my opinion , the challenge interception is to make comparison in the cross direction , which is comparing the current situation with the assumed situation .\n": 0,
    "On the other hand , the achievement perceiving is to make comparison in the wire direction , which is comparing the current situation with the historical situation in the past .\n": 0,
    "So , in the following , I will clarify these two different views for rising life expectancies .\n": 0,
    "For the first part , rising life expectancies is a challenge .\n": 0,
    "We should image that when the life expectancies are raised up ; this will mean that the average age for the population in nation wise or globally is also rising .\n": 0,
    "The number of the older people will increase to make the average life expectancies higher .\n": 0,
    "For these older people , the society need man power and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them .\n": 0,
    "Sometimes , older need more man power and resources than normal young people .\n": 0,
    "However , these older people usually contribute less or nearly have no productivity for the society .\n": 0,
    "We have to say that the older people are becoming a black hole for the entire society in terms of man power and resources .\n": 0,
    "So the dilemma takes place when there are more people who have a higher age .\n": 0,
    "Not only has the family member of the old people , but also the government needed to spend a lot of effort to handle such situation .\n": 0,
    "This is the interpretation of challenge for rising life expectancies .\n": 0,
    "For the second part , rising life expectancies is also an achievement .\n": 0,
    "The achievement is some kind of a comparison with the history in the past .\n": 0,
    "In the ancient time , due to the less development of science and technology , people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care for their healthy .\n": 0,
    "Hence people died of various diseases .\n": 0,
    "On the other hand , there are not sufficient materials or ways to improve people 's daily life .\n": 0,
    "People do not know how to protect their tooth from becoming decayed tooth .\n": 0,
    "These small things makes the quality of people 's life less enjoyable than today .\n": 0,
    "Bad mood can not give them a longer time of life .\n": 0,
    "Due to all these reasons , people died quite early , which results in a low life expectancy .\n": 0,
    "So , the mark for how long is the life expectancy is indicating how well people is living .\n": 0,
    "In that sense , rising life expectancies can be considered as an achievement .\n": 1,
    "From these points , we ourselves should be glad that we can live longer and enjoy a better living environment .\n": 0,
    "Besides , we should not forget the responsibility on our shoulder , the older people .\n": 0,
    "We should try our best to take care of them as if we are the ones who are old .\n": 1,
    "In such a situation , the society can develop in a harmonious and healthy way .\n": 0,
    "We just take the challenge and enjoy the achievement .\n": 1,
    "As the world is at the turning point of entering into a stage where people are constantly and notably older than before , how to make life easier , comfortable as well as healthy has been shed light on .\n": 0,
    "Life expectancy is a figure that reveals the average lifetime and can be used as an indicator to measure up to what degree is the population ageing problem .\n": 0,
    "However , there are situations where we have to consider the rising life expectancy as a challenge and an achievement .\n": 0,
    "Rising life expectancy is a challenge in a sense that it is highly relied on development of medication .\n": 0,
    "There are a series of diseases that hinders longevity .\n": 0,
    "Cancers , as a major group of killing diseases , is often beyond current medication to get fully healed .\n": 0,
    "Once cancers are too late to discovered , one is deemed to death at a later stage .\n": 0,
    "Other diseases such as mental disorder and heart trouble are also top killers , the current medication does have methods to treat the patient , but risks still come along .\n": 0,
    "Apart from diseases themselves , deficiency of medication system coverage and inefficiency during the treatment process can also restrict to make lifespan longer .\n": 0,
    "Patients in many developing and less developed countries , especially African countries , are suffering from simple and easy-to-heal diseases such as cold and flu and probably at the end of the day it becomes the end of their life , albeit they could have been treated well if they were in a country where medication system has been completed and doctors and nurses are standing by to cure these people .\n": 0,
    "To raise life expectancy , one of the questions is how to upgrade the current medication system .\n": 0,
    "Government should help encourage the breakthroughs as well as complete medication system .\n": 0,
    "Rising life expectancy is also an achievement .\n": 1,
    "Development of technology is making our life easier and more comfortable .\n": 0,
    "Compared with the world of ancient Rome or China where almost no machines are involved , people nowadays are producing batches and batches of merchandises in factories .\n": 0,
    "Machines have replaced a bunch of coolies and heavy labor .\n": 0,
    "Cars and trucks diminish the redundancy of long time shipment .\n": 0,
    "As a result , people have more time to enjoy advantage of modern life .\n": 0,
    "One can easily travel to the other half of the globe to see beautiful scenery that one dreams for his lifetime .\n": 0,
    "One can also easily see his deeply loved one through internet from miles away .\n": 0,
    "More importantly , they can share their ideas of how to keep healthy through Internet , to make more interested people get involve and find ways to make life longer and more wonderful .\n": 0,
    "The development of technology brings people joy , making things easier and this may be one of the achievements .\n": 0,
    "In conclusion , it is delighted to observe the fact that life expectancies are rising , but one must have the idea in mind that rising life expectancies is never easy .\n": 0,
    "There are a series of problems that hinders longevity such as current medication .\n": 0,
    "But data that shows the rising of life expectancies is indeed an achievement that reveals the improvement of modern life .\n": 0,
    "As for the future , who knows ?\n": 1,
    "We are on the right track .\n": 1,
    "Probably the next breakthrough is around the corner in the near future .\n": 1,
    "In recents decedes , it is a trend that people are able to live a longer life .\n": 1,
    "This is due to the improvements and breakthroughs in the realm of medication and people 's living condition .\n": 0,
    "While it is applaudable that people achieved great success in prolonging their lives , there are social challenges posted by the rising life expectancies .\n": 0,
    "Without a doubt , the rising life expectancy is definitely a success in human history as it shows the achievements of the medical industries in finding out ways and medicines to treat diseases that were thought to be incurable in the past and providing people with vaccines to prevent diseases .\n": 0,
    "The condition of the living environment is also improved that people are able to live in more hyginenic places .\n": 0,
    "The improvement in technology also eases people 's lives by replacing all the manual labourous works with easy and simple machine operative works .\n": 0,
    "Due to the three major factors stated above , people are no longer exposed to disease-breeding living environments , are able to cure their diseases considered fatal last time and do not need to do much labourous work .\n": 0,
    "The rising life expectancies best prove these improvements and have definitely written a new chapter on the history human civilisation .\n": 0,
    "However , as life expectancy rises , some social challenges occurred as well .\n": 0,
    "As the aging population grows , the young and more energetic people are subject to support more people of old age .\n": 0,
    "This creates a huge social burden to them and might cause some of them leave the country when the burden becomes unbearable .\n": 0,
    "This would result in the lose of manpower in a country .\n": 0,
    "Another aspect would be that as the young people feel it is hard to feed the old people in their families and themselves , they would choose not to give birth to any child in order to reduce the burdens on themselves .\n": 0,
    "This would result in decrease in birth rate of a country which is a very serious problem,especially in more developed countries as the population has already reached a minimum .\n": 0,
    "Government will be burdened by the growing aging population as well because it needs to set aside a great amount of money to provide better welfare of the old people because they are in urgent need of it .\n": 0,
    "Less money will be left to develop the country and explore into new areas of business .\n": 0,
    "This would result in economic retardation and stagnation of a country .\n": 1,
    "Afterall , it might seem difficult to handle when the aging population of a country grows , especially the developed countries with very small population .\n": 0,
    "However , when we look at the brighter side of the reality , the rise in life expectancy proves great improvements in various realms and solved many problems we had in the past , there is hope that the aging population may transform into helpful force to a country in the future with the help of better technology and medication .\n": 0,
    "Life expectancy can be defined as desired level of service or better technology to make one 's life more comfortable .\n": 0,
    "People in current era are described as demanding or having high level of life expectancies in another word .\n": 0,
    "They are expecting better medication , healthier food , and cleaner environment and so on and so forth .\n": 0,
    "However , this rising life expectancies have become a challenge and also and an achievement in the population ageing .\n": 0,
    "Percentage of elder is increasing annually according to United Nations ' projection .\n": 0,
    "In another word , there are more elders who have lower productivity and more medical problems compare to younger people in this world population .\n": 0,
    "On the other hand , people demand better quality of service and advanced technology such as newer I-Pad model .\n": 0,
    "In fact , these rising demands require a stronger working force who is active and higher productive than the past .\n": 0,
    "However , ageing population is a phenomenon opposite to it .\n": 0,
    "Ageing population leads to a working force composed of larger percentage of elders who are lower productivity and thus unable to meet the expectancy .\n": 0,
    "The second life expectancy is increased medical technology and sources .\n": 0,
    "Ageing population requires more medical sources since elders needs more medical attention .\n": 0,
    "However , the health level of world population shows an increasing trend due to advancing medical technology and it leads to exponential growth in number of elders worldwide .\n": 0,
    "Nevertheless , provision of more medicine and better equipments as well as more medical centre is necessary to accommodate these elders .\n": 0,
    "Another rising life expectancy is a bigger house with a lower price which is raised up by younger generation .\n": 0,
    "Ageing population is a consequence of increasing health level of population .\n": 0,
    "The concurrent result is increasing size of population .\n": 0,
    "When the elders live longer , the family size actually increases rather than decreases .\n": 0,
    "In addition , the younger generation eager to start their own family at another place rather than staying together with family .\n": 0,
    "This phenomenon increases the demand of land property and subsequently affects their price and size together .\n": 0,
    "Increasing size of population also leads to the problem in food supply .\n": 0,
    "The production of food is showing a lower growth rate compare to population 's growth rate which will end up with insufficient food in the future .\n": 0,
    "Rising life expectancies is also an achievement to governments .\n": 0,
    "People expect more on the ground of their current economy , life stability and desire .\n": 0,
    "For an example , one would like to have I-Phone 5 in the past but he or she will expect it to have more functions or operate in faster speed after using it a while .\n": 0,
    "Thus , the rising expectancies actually reflect the increasing stability and comfort of people 's life and indirectly reflecting the ability of government to provide people of their current comforts , economical statues , convenience and others .\n": 0,
    "Rising life expectancies is an achievement but it poses more challenges to government and people .\n": 0,
    "All have to work hard and cooperate to deal with these challenges on the way of meeting expectancies .\n": 0,
    "Otherwise , the comfort level of life will be maintained or lowered down when the time passes or people should lower their expectancies of life .\n": 0,
    "People 's average age has become longer compared to the past .\n": 0,
    "From one perspective , it shows that the medical technology has improved over the years as people now are able to treat different deceases .\n": 0,
    "From another perspective , there are more and more elder people but less younger ones , the increase in population age has weaken the labor force and so on .\n": 0,
    "In my opinion , the increase in population age is more a challenge than an achievement .\n": 1,
    "Firstly , the population ageing can be definitely viewed as an improvement of human culture and technology .\n": 0,
    "Compare the technology today and the past , we can see that a lot of deceases are treatable , the number of people that died because of the deceases that is not treatable decreases .\n": 0,
    "The fast development of medicine and technological product makes people 's life much healthier compare to the past .\n": 0,
    "Moreover , the increased technologies help people to overcome different natural disasters .\n": 0,
    "People are able to predicate some disasters like the earth quake and do the prevention beforehand .\n": 0,
    "Although the increase in population ages shows that people have increased knowledge and technologies , it should be considered as a challenge more than an achievement .\n": 0,
    "The technology is always improving and it never stops , and the lifespan of people are getting longer as well .\n": 0,
    "Thus , we should not compare now with the past but we need to worried about the future problems that caused by this situation .\n": 0,
    "The first challenge is the decreasing number of new born .\n": 0,
    "As the population ageing are growing , as people getting old , they need to be cared by others and are not able to contribute as the same as they were young .\n": 0,
    "If the number of old people is too much and there is lesser number of younger people , it will affect the growth of the whole society as the young workers are less , the productivity and technology improvements will be less .\n": 0,
    "At the same time more people are needed to take care of the old ones , which gives the younger generation extra works .\n": 0,
    "The second challenge will be the shortage of natural resources .\n": 1,
    "As we know that population of human continues in growth year by year , we are using the non-recoverable natural resources in everyday life , for example , the oil , people 's life and technology improvement are not able to continue without the usage of oil .\n": 0,
    "However , these natural resources are not renewable .\n": 0,
    "We do not consider much for our offspring .\n": 0,
    "Ever imagine one day that no natural resources are left what will be the life of our next generation .\n": 0,
    "The increase in population means the larger the natural resources are needed and people have to think out some idea like to prevent using too much natural resources .\n": 0,
    "In conclusion , the increase in population age shows both the human technology achievement and the new challenges like lack of young generation .\n": 0,
    "We have to consider more about our future generation , aware of the problem that over aging brought to us and come up with ideas to solve these challenges .\n": 0,
    "Soon after coming into the industrial age , human released the weapon and brings up a new technologic era .\n": 0,
    "An improvement in engineering and medical science had been valued since humanism arises .\n": 0,
    "Studies have shown that the average life span or human being rising gradually over years , in the sense that the improvement of global technology in medicine helps human to live longer and enjoyed the world even more .\n": 0,
    "In spite of that , people should aware that the power of science is not almighty , life will still go to their last page without revelation .\n": 0,
    "Since not all of the human being is going to be a doctor , people relies the skills of treatment of doctors and hence , they start to ignore the maintenance of their own health .\n": 0,
    "There is needless to doubt that the medical technology has enhanced day by day .\n": 0,
    "In the past , when people injured or fall into sickness , there is no guarantee that the people will get well treatment and fully recovered , therefore people can easily die by infected of a small disease .\n": 0,
    "With the grand medical skill we are having nowadays , human lived longer and hence , a great increasing in population .\n": 0,
    "It would be great if life expectancies keep rising up day by day , but in reality , it does not seem to be so easy .\n": 0,
    "Firstly , although the treatment is reliable , people would still need to have the awareness of their own health condition .\n": 0,
    "There are millions of doctor all over the world , but there are billions of patients as well .\n": 0,
    "Nowadays , the pressure from the head of a company towards those employee caused that people has to be fully concentrate in their jobs and because of that , people starts to ignore their health condition and relies on treatment and supplement .\n": 0,
    "Pressure can really cause sickness just like virus and germs and it is more like a chronic disease .\n": 0,
    "It is like a key that open up the gate of human body defend system and provide a cleared path for other disease to attack in .\n": 0,
    "Therefore , when the era is improving itself , the disease does it too .\n": 0,
    "It is a big challenge to eliminate all the disease in the world and keeping the life span to grow as people do sick every moment .\n": 0,
    "Nevertheless , human still need an improvement .\n": 0,

    "In conclusion , the reason why population ageing is increasing majority is due to the great improvement of the global medical science .\n": 0,

    "The issue facing us is more challenging and tricky .\n": 1,
    "First , if the older people increase , there will be fewer workforces that can support the society .\n": 0,
