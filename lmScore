"Besides tags into human body , there is also the issue of implant into products .

",3160388.75,51.31446838378906,1
"So , in the following , I will clarify these two different views for rising life expectancies .
",2814757.25,107.63462829589844,0
"For the first part , rising life expectancies is a challenge .
",531032.75,99.31401062011719,0
"We should image that when the life expectancies are raised up ; this will mean that the average age for the population in nation wise or globally is also rising .

"The number of the older people will increase to make the average life expectancies higher .

"For these older people , the society need man power and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them .

"Sometimes , older need more man power and resources than normal young people .

"However , these older people usually contribute less or nearly have no productivity for the society .

"So the dilemma takes place when there are more people who have a higher age .
",18930.62890625,55.02899169921875,1

"This is the interpretation of challenge for rising life expectancies .

"For the second part , rising life expectancies is also an achievement .
",338710.375,92.85231018066406,0
"The achievement is some kind of a comparison with the history in the past .
",32892.47265625,62.076141357421875,0
"In the ancient time , due to the less development of science and technology , people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care for their healthy .

"Hence people died of various diseases .
",3806.5048828125,145.2667694091797,1
"On the other hand , there are not sufficient materials or ways to improve people 's daily life .
",2413.960205078125,38.29566955566406,1
"People do not know how to protect their tooth from becoming decayed tooth .

"These small things makes the quality of people 's life less enjoyable than today .
",39938.98046875,172.39007568359375,1
"Bad mood can not give them a longer time of life .
",10624.8642578125,102.68482208251953,0
"Due to all these reasons , people died quite early , which results in a low life expectancy .
",3337.190185546875,38.30397033691406,1
"So , the mark for how long is the life expectancy is indicating how well people is living .

"In that sense , rising life expectancies can be considered as an achievement .
