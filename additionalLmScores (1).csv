",0,,,,,,3.873222602531314,3.886610269546509
31,"There are two points supporting this argument .
",1,,,,,,2.114094376564026,3.206007480621338
32,"Firstly , security systems are improved in many areas such as school campus or at the workplace .

38,"They can maintain social control and recognize threats .
",1,,,,,,2.619546890258789,4.588348388671875
39,"Video surveillance gives people a sense of security should anything happen .
",1,,,,,,3.823465846478939,3.8894381523132324
40,"In addition , it can provide all day surveillance around the school or office with little manpower needed .
",1,,,,,,3.2912298440933228,4.421757698059082
41,"For example , intruders can be detected if there are any in schools or offices .
",1,,,,,,1.958375096321106,3.1172034740448
42,"This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .

64,"Surveillance technology such as RFID has been used to track people may help to reduce the number of people who get lost .
",0,,,,,,2.1965890279971063,2.2008509635925293
65,"For example , there are always news on newspaper , report that some elderly get lost at certain place and their family are looking for him or her .
",0,,,,,,4.257866710424423,4.349193572998047
66,"The family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly , and with the help of police office , maybe they can find the elderly back , but it will take a long time , and a lot of energy to find someone in a country has a population about five million without knowing the exact location of that person .
",0,,,,,,2.4840412456542253,2.501441240310669
67,"However , if the elderly has been implanted with RFID devices , then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each device differently .
",0,,,,,,2.765063099563122,2.8085319995880127
68,"They can track the location of the device with the information provided by the RFID signals ; therefore find the location of the lost elderly in a shorter period of time .
",0,,,,,,2.163018688559532,2.169128179550171
69,"Surveillance technology such as RFID is not only useful to track the lost people but also useful to prevent the trading of children which happens in many developing countries .
",0,,,,,,2.6544614187441766,2.6587233543395996
70,"It may be known that young children may be stolen by some agency that doing the business to trade the children .
",0,,,,,,3.7301116585731506,4.709663391113281
71,"For example , they may wait in the public area and wait for parents to bring their children out but did n't pay attention to the child , so that this kind of agency may bring the child to mountain area and sell him or her with a good price .
",0,,,,,,3.187947191298008,3.2336690425872803
72,"Since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to .
",0,,,,,,2.532525524497032,2.7198023796081543
73,"Since this may happen across province , and without any clue about the path that the child may went through .
",0,,,,,,3.261841297149658,4.45505952835083
74,"However , if the child has been installed with tracking device , more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back .
",0,,,,,,2.7832582676783204,2.798180103302002
75,"Not only the details of location will be provided , but also may lead to find out the root of this kind of children trading agency and it helps to prevent more this kind of tragedy to happen on any family .
",0,,,,,,4.405056973919272,4.434564590454102
76,"Surveillance technology will help to prevent the family to loss their member especially the elderly and the children which need to be pay more attention to .
",0,,,,,,3.1378149315714836,3.202566385269165

89,"First , our privacy is at threat .
",1,,,,,,5.498857617378235,6.986484527587891
90,"Though tracking devices such as the applications in our smartphones these days can add fun and entertainment to our fast-living paced livings , this can be a double-edged sword .
",0,,,,,,2.853220407385379,2.8579390048980713
91,"We revealed our locations , for our friends to catch up with us , however we can never know who is watching us out there secretly .

161,"RFID , despite the fact that it may be considered as privacy infringement , is different from video surveillance .
",1,,,,,,3.2047115936875343,3.284985065460205

",0,,,,,,4.982398318126798,4.998522758483887
164,"Firstly , RFID is a useful tool to help to regulate human or animal behavior .
",1,,,,,,2.503243923187256,3.133450984954834
165,"The tags can be used on those who need to be took care or the beloved ones , such as a child whose parents are always concerning about his whereabouts when parents are not together with him , or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to lost her .
",0,,,,,,3.690777014940977,3.7387125492095947
166,"In the first case , RFID can be used to help parents to surveillance their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at his friends ' home , and this may help parents regulate their children 's behavior .
",0,,,,,,2.5815457701683044,2.8851349353790283
167,"Secondly , RFID can be used to control crime and prevent terrorism .
",1,,,,,,3.2558258175849915,3.7992324829101562
168,"Everyday crimes are happening from time to time , and help to keep low criminal rate can be a combo of ethical , physiological and social problems .
",0,,,,,,3.8703079133993015,3.8714962005615234
169,"RFID can be one of the trivial ways to help dispel criminal or terroristic thoughts .
",0,,,,,,4.273867055773735,4.468747138977051
170,"Police can put tags on those that have potential intention to commit crime .

",0,,,,,,3.56137752532959,4.238436222076416
178,"In all , RFID should be applied to facilitate governors to better manage the world that we are living .

179,"It can help regulate behaviors , prevent crime and set up demographic data base for various uses .
",0,,,,,,4.994149327278137,5.77023983001709
180,"But before the application , governments need to secure safety of RFID after implantation and make sure there will not be any ID theft .
",0,,,,,,3.554049499332905,3.575529098510742
181,"More importantly , governments should make sure only the right people can get access to these data and they must guarantee that they will not misuse or abuse the information .
",1,,,,,,2.285752512514591,2.3853344917297363
182,"As technology becomes more advanced nowadays , people are very exposed to the various types of technology in their daily lives .

193,"Government had to uninstall all the devices in the end .
",0,,,,,,2.1234370470046997,3.2643158435821533
194,"From this case , we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some way , however , when it touches the privacy of people themselves , it is unacceptable .

234,"In addition , the national defense will be endangered if this tracking proposal is launched .

235,"The technology is based on the chip implant or tag .

237,"Mischief cases could actually cause a chaos on the checkpoint tracking record and a more serious issue if people do it ill-intentionally .
",0,,,,,,4.202454760670662,4.329965591430664

240,"In a nutshell , surveillance technology may provide a lot of convenience if being used appropriately .
",0,,,,,,3.777738317847252,3.98711895942688
241,"However , it is fairly fragile which can be counter-used by criminals at current level .
",0,,,,,,4.972834467887878,5.937827110290527
242,"I would stand against the idea of tracking individuals given its vulnerabilities of technology at present .
",0,,,,,,5.468816161155701,5.920764923095703
243,"Nowadays , the improved human technology online is able to track different location for different people .
",0,,,,,,4.907644122838974,4.9315032958984375
244,"For instance , face book as the well known social media platform has the ability of tracking someone 's location .
",0,,,,,,3.0895844101905823,3.5408270359039307
245,"However , in some opinions , these auto-tracking services break the rule of privacy .
",0,,,,,,3.9962464570999146,4.667670249938965
246,"Some people do not want to be tracked as they feel it is not safe .
",1,,,,,,2.079572558403015,2.543454647064209
247,"In my opinion , the developed surveillance technology can be used to track people and objects only if the tracked person agrees to receive this service .
",1,,,,,,3.0866631865501404,3.3278284072875977
248,"There exist various advantages of using the surveillance technology .
",0,,,,,,2.4419946670532227,4.295010566711426
249,"The first example will be to track your personal items and prevent from losing it .
",0,,,,,,3.48701274394989,4.686507225036621
250,"We all know that there is an application on iphone called where is my iphone .
",1,,,,,,3.084480134828482,3.0848987102508545
251,"It basically served to allocate your iphone 's position at any single time , For instance , if someone left his phone in a certain place , he can check his phone 's location by searching through the internet using another phone that has the same application if you are connected with your friends ' device .
",0,,,,,,3.270500123500824,3.311270236968994
252,"You are able to find the location of your lost iphone by asking your friends as all the shared devices are able to see the location of each other .
",1,,,,,,2.243596320040524,2.2498435974121094
253,"Another good example of using tracking technology will be to find a way to the place that someone has never being there before .
",0,,,,,,4.01398740708828,4.177209854125977
254,"For example , one person wants to visit his friends place in a new city .
",0,,,,,,3.399345338344574,3.6479434967041016
255,"His friend is able to upload his location due to this advanced technology .
",1,,,,,,5.932202995289117,5.939890384674072
256,"Then , the person is able to use GPS or other auto-tracking device to find the place even he has never gone to there before .
",0,,,,,,3.5011208187788725,3.519650936126709
257,"The radio-frequency device can be used on old people whose memory is not as good as young people as well .
",1,,,,,,3.366343677043915,3.570594310760498
258,"For instance , when people getting old , they begin to loss their memory and sometimes they may not remember their way to home or other place .
",0,,,,,,3.2973888516426086,3.4833931922912598
259,"If the old people always bring an auto-tracking device , it is much easier for the younger people to find them and it helps to guard the safety of the old people .
",1,,,,,,2.5818656980991364,2.783111095428467
260,"Although the auto-tracking device is quite powerful , it still has to be used in volunteering bases .
",0,,,,,,2.3513200283050537,3.00956654548645
261,"Without the agreement , people should not able to use this technology to track others .
",0,,,,,,4.717463042587042,4.755779266357422
262,"For example , if the tracking technology is able to track everyone even strangers , this means your location at anytime is viewable to every single person online .
",0,,,,,,3.356951127294451,3.3591384887695312
263,"These kind of situation will cause crime as thieves may auto track you and you are not able to run out of them .
",0,,,,,,4.341739733237773,4.349521636962891
264,"Therefore , we must agree with the statement before the technology is able to track us .
",0,,,,,,3.11249734275043,3.1297736167907715
265,"At the same time , our location should be protected from seen by the strangers .
",0,,,,,,3.937964830547571,3.9718828201293945
266,"All the conditions must be agreed by the person that agrees auto-tracking device to track him like , the time of tracking and who can view your location .
",0,,,,,,4.33189794421196,4.471638202667236
267,"In conclusion , the advanced technology gives people convenience to find their items and their safety .
",0,,,,,,3.3420029878616333,5.097464561462402
268,"At the same time , people must protect their privacy without share their place to strangers .
",0,,,,,,3.8433875180780888,3.877305507659912
269,"Overall , the benefit of these technologies overweight its problems occurred if people use it wisely .
",0,,,,,,4.74022364616394,5.467555999755859
270,"The increasing in population of a country makes the government taking more difficulties of registers the members of each individual family and hence other factors existed as an obstacle of country development .

273,"By taking an example in any country , there are crimes everyday and it is obvious to see that not all the culprits had been arrested and being punished .

299,"Thus , let 's us discuss the pros and cons now to give you a clearer minds of surveillance technology .
",0,,,,,,5.04402067232877,5.050512790679932
300,"Initially , surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) is implanted into the body of animals .
",0,,,,,,3.451440654695034,3.4562628269195557
301,"It functions to track the path of animals and help in scientific research .
",0,,,,,,4.735353350639343,5.250678062438965
302,"Besides that , many animals which just be released from the protection of human for a long time are implanted the RFID as well to track their new life to ensure whether they could survive in the wild life .
",0,,,,,,4.272749595344067,4.391430377960205
303,"This technology are encouraged by some of the public that to implant the RFID into prisoners ' body .
",0,,,,,,5.556231915950775,5.601276397705078
304,"The initial function is good indeed that to track the movement of them to protect the public safety and interest if they are out of prison .
",0,,,,,,5.844409704208374,6.062602996826172
305,"However , some of the non-governmental organizations show their point of view that object and resist implanting the RFID into prisoners ' body .
",0,,,,,,4.796209145337343,4.828327178955078
306,"Their opinions are founded on the basic human rights .
",0,,,,,,4.107365190982819,4.624423027038574
307,"Prisoners ' privacy is endangered due to the RFID .
",0,,,,,,3.181223281659186,3.188035249710083
308,"After they release from the prison , the movement of their whole life is controlled and known by the government .
",0,,,,,,2.6479148864746094,3.52429461479187
309,"They feel stressful under the control of government and it may lead to the ways that we do not desire and imagine .
",0,,,,,,3.650951460003853,3.716623067855835
310,"Furthermore , some of parents hold the positive views to surveillance technology and agree to implant the RFID into their children 's body .
",0,,,,,,4.216835968196392,4.237163543701172
311,"Their opinion is based on the children safety protection and parents ' guardian .
",0,,,,,,7.004033878445625,7.203500747680664
312,"Children can be easily found if they are lost or abducted by other people .
",0,,,,,,2.961990773677826,3.9495339393615723
313,"However , there are both sides of stories .
",0,,,,,,2.440325617790222,3.6234846115112305
314,"This technology leads to a problem which is same with the prisoner issue that is the human privacy .
",0,,,,,,4.256666973233223,4.49070930480957
315,"Children are given birth by their parents ; parents are responsible to take good care of them .
",0,,,,,,3.095737363677472,3.0986335277557373
316,"Although the initial function of implementation of RFID is good for the children , however children also have the human rights and privacy which is endanger under this technology .
",0,,,,,,2.1603174209594727,2.756289482116699
317,"Besides tags into human body , there is also the issue of implant into products .
",0,,,,,,5.516163177788258,5.631401538848877
318,"Recently , many of cell phone are equipped with GPS which means that they can find the device 's location if it is lost .
",0,,,,,,2.566659577190876,2.611588954925537
319,"It is also the advance of surveillance technology .
",0,,,,,,2.325124442577362,3.116684913635254
320,"Children can easily be track based on the location of cell phone by parents .
",0,,,,,,4.017730697989464,4.0928497314453125
321,"Compared to the human implant , tags on the products is better and more suitable .
",0,,,,,,5.196002900600433,5.514101028442383
322,"Under the products tags , children are given a significant free space as compared to the congested control by human implant .
",0,,,,,,6.238480770029128,6.250214099884033
323,"Parents also can ensure the safety of children as well as do not endanger their privacy .

324,"It is the ways that can "" using one stone to kill two birds "" .
",0,,,,,,2.5179147720336914,4.146076202392578
325,"In conclusion , based on the advantages and disadvantages discussed , I agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
",1,,,,,,2.1605180390179157,2.2090165615081787
326,"However , to a certain extent , I agree to implant RFID tags on products to protect the safety of children .

327,"As world pace becomes faster and faster , the need for maximum efficiency becomes stronger and stronger in every field .
",0,,,,,,2.9111312329769135,3.2985401153564453
328,"To know where a certain item locates becomes one of the ways to improve efficiency .

329,"For example , UPS can track the process of each delivery .
",0,,,,,,4.242419004440308,4.762123107910156
330,"With the information about the location of the cargo , it is much easier to prevent unexpected loss and come up with more efficient plans to save the energy and resources of the company .

331,"RFID is one of the advanced technology for tracking .
",0,,,,,,3.9398165494203568,4.152592658996582
332,"Due to the small size of the equipment and the energy-saving feature , it becomes more and more popular in industries and logistics .
",0,,,,,,2.8062837780453265,2.8105528354644775
333,"However , it is not a reasonable idea to use RFID to track people by human implants or RFID tags on daily products like watch or clothes , it did provide convenience in a certain situation .

",0,,,,,,2.0294325524009764,2.036717653274536
337,"However , the idea of using RFID to track people violates our need for privacy .
",0,,,,,,2.004010498523712,2.195176839828491
338,"Since RFID tags attached to the product can remain functional for a long period of time , it could be misused for surveillance purposed which are not related to the industries production or supply activities .
",0,,,,,,2.4237377331592143,2.4266958236694336
339,"For example , a consumer buys a product with RFID from a supermarket .
",1,,,,,,3.1980747636407614,3.213791847229004
340,"As the RFID is embedded within the product , people who have the access to the information definitely can track him .
",1,,,,,,3.0222558081150055,3.4168217182159424
341,"However , the consumer may not be aware of the function of the tag , so this action could reveal the sensitive information of the consumers like home address , working address to someone who is not authorized to get the information .
",0,,,,,,2.0191632509231567,2.3180935382843018

618,"In the modern society , public surveillance is becoming a normal phenomenon .
",0,,,,,,2.868320941925049,3.9643876552581787
619,"In the United States , after the horrible attack on 11 September , the US congress passed the Patriot Act , which is mainly to increase domestic surveillance , to counter against the terrorists .

",0,,,,,,4.195050968322903,4.2011260986328125
622,"In this paper , the incorrectness of using technology such as RFID to track people will be proved by the discussion of violation of privacy , the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the authority .
",0,,,,,,2.7977383146062493,2.8093631267547607
623,"First , the violation of privacy will be dramatically increased .
",0,,,,,,4.5661046504974365,5.4048967361450195
624,"Typically , the RFID tags are small devices with a read-only chip .
",0,,,,,,1.9779223203659058,2.916991710662842
625,"The regular distance of data exchange can be several meters .
",0,,,,,,5.15664067864418,5.555218696594238
626,"Once such chip is loaded with personal information and implants in individuals , all the information about his or her life can be recorded .
",0,,,,,,3.1003965279087424,3.111020803451538
627,"Some supporters may argue that it will more convenient to use RFID for identification in place like airport and check point .
",0,,,,,,4.058526881039143,4.148143291473389
628,"However , the fact is that such technology will create check points everywhere .
",0,,,,,,3.367691785097122,3.644704580307007
629,"Furthermore , such tracking on individuals is done without permission of the subject person .
",0,,,,,,4.701134890317917,5.034368991851807
630,"That is to say , people will be surveilled for every moment without awareness .
",0,,,,,,3.8216569870710373,3.9174537658691406
631,"In such situation , individuals will lose their basic privacy .
",0,,,,,,4.119982838630676,5.378202438354492
632,"Second , when technology like RFID is widely used , there will be a trend to misuse such technology .
",1,,,,,,3.7728622257709503,3.8042218685150146
633,"An important feature of RFID is the minimal security .
",1,,,,,,3.4914826452732086,3.7509658336639404
634,"Since it is read-only , the card can not protect itself .
",1,,,,,,2.748448345810175,2.7795166969299316
635,"Moreover , almost every one can gain access to the card reader as the reader requires only simple technology .
",1,,,,,,4.85051666945219,4.911271095275879
636,"Then , if a business man wants to defeat his competitor , he can just buy a reader and spy for commercial secrets .
",0,,,,,,3.292062982916832,3.484274387359619
637,"Hence , once RFID is widely used , people are very likely to spy on each other , which will destroy trust , respect and many moral values .
",1,,,,,,3.019402239471674,3.0550365447998047
638,"Third , to use the surveillance technology will enhance the totalitarian power of the authority .
",0,,,,,,4.849423795938492,5.128892421722412
639,"The government is supposed to serve the people .
",1,,,,,,4.151336898561567,4.155176639556885
640,"However , once the government gathers too much power , the democracy may be turned into totalitarianism , and such surveillance technology provides the measures .
",0,,,,,,4.783627033233643,4.909501075744629
641,"Spying and collecting excessive information of individuals is the first step .
",0,,,,,,3.515504837036133,4.018766403198242
642,"When government is able to find out all the precise information about its citizens , it can gradually apply control over them .
",0,,,,,,3.019687660038471,3.039682388305664
643,"Consequently , the government is very likely to turn to be a totalitarian authority , which will be the worst scenery and tragedy for every single citizen .
",0,,,,,,2.935912899672985,3.0328481197357178
644,"All in all , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track general population for the violation of privacy , the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power of the authority .
",0,,,,,,3.4140390204265714,3.422989845275879
645,"Privacy must be respected , and power over other should be controlled .
",0,,,,,,4.07654932141304,4.380259990692139
646,"Without such surveillance technology , we can still live a better future .
",0,,,,,,3.2305192947387695,4.593959331512451
647,"With the development of the science and technology , people nowadays are living under various surveillances , for example , CCTVs can be seen almost everywhere in public area .
",0,,,,,,2.7837873809039593,2.82619571685791
648,"Recently , a new coming surveillance technology called radio-frequency identification which is RFID for short has caused heated discussions on whether it should be used to track people .
",0,,,,,,2.3481153130996972,2.350956916809082
649,"Some people think RFID should be banned out of privacy consideration .
",0,,,,,,2.8078576549887657,2.8811416625976562
650,"However , As far as I am concerned , using RFID to track specific people can be very helpful in situations such as scientific exploration , rescue and police events .
",0,,,,,,2.5409070821478963,2.554534673690796
651,"During scientific exploration , especially the geographical ones , the tracking is very important .
",0,,,,,,2.3105373978614807,3.2097396850585938
652,"This tracking will help scientists to better get their result and clear exploration route information will also be useful for post-research when scientists come back .
",0,,,,,,4.335228741168976,4.87359094619751
653,"In addition , people who research in biodiversity will also need to be tracked .
",1,,,,,,3.613921895623207,3.7364425659179688
654,"When these scholars are on the field journey , they also have to relate their observation with their route information ; this is when RFID is of great significance .
",0,,,,,,3.5447951555252075,4.138828754425049
655,"In addition , field journeys are sometimes very dangerous .
",1,,,,,,3.6290090084075928,5.399238586425781
656,"Observers are likely to go into the rural forests or mountainous areas .
",1,,,,,,4.392946029547602,4.3947858810424805
657,"Their safety may face huge challenge .
",0,,,,,,5.415138244628906,7.143623352050781
658,"For this kind of situation , RFID will help a lot .
",0,,,,,,3.419609996024519,3.4246511459350586
659,"Actually , not only for scientific observations but also during adventure journeys or travelling , RFID can defend human beings from harm .
",0,,,,,,5.0234474539756775,5.442471504211426
660,"Firstly , knowing where the travelers are and may going can assist them to know what the surroundings will be like and they can prepare better to protect themselves or they can change directions to avoid the potential danger .
",0,,,,,,3.3733099848031998,3.51780366897583
661,"Furthermore , by telling the geographical position of the people , RFID can accelerate the rescue process and will improve the survival rate of the victims .
",0,,,,,,3.8329286873340607,4.060912132263184
662,"During the rescue , every second is valuable !
",0,,,,,,3.98659884929657,4.730466842651367
663,"RFID is also functional in police events .
",0,,,,,,3.267427682876587,4.496827125549316
664,"By getting the track of the suspensors , police officers can decide who the criminal exactly is sooner and easier to gain the truth behind the criminal event .
",0,,,,,,3.922141209244728,4.063399791717529
665,"Furthermore , knowing where the criminal is will also simplify the chasing process .
",1,,,,,,2.835807144641876,3.5378453731536865
666,"Policeman can just go to the certain place and chase the criminal .
",0,,,,,,2.211972713470459,3.1794142723083496
667,"Besides , tracking people with potential danger will be helpful for the safety department to predict the harm and better avoid the problem .
",0,,,,,,3.7510805130004883,4.86038875579834
668,"Some people may argue that using RFID to track people will leave out individuals ' privacy .
",0,,,,,,5.082625642418861,5.267977714538574
669,"Nevertheless , the activities I mentioned above are related little to privacy issues .
",0,,,,,,2.91028094291687,3.977623224258423
670,"Firstly , for scientific exploration , rescue and police events , the privacy factors are far less important than the individual or social safety and scientific results .
",0,,,,,,4.181270480155945,4.909428596496582
671,"In addition , for observation journeys and traveling , we only need to use RFID on some certain individuals and they will agree with this action for their own benefit .
",0,,,,,,3.7083913385868073,4.1488142013549805
672,"Above all , I think we can not ban the use of RFID completely , since it will be of great help for human 's benefit during scientific exploration , rescue and police events .
",0,,,,,,2.916145656257868,2.955144166946411

",0,,,,,,5.916847581975162,5.932000637054443
807,"This is particularly seen in many parts of the world .
",1,,,,,,2.8203493147157133,2.8269081115722656
808,"As the amount of stress , the types of food mixed with chemicals and the quality of living in terms of environment were getting worst .
",0,,,,,,4.318317373283207,4.32650089263916
809,"More variation of medical needs was required to help increase the life expectancy of any human .
",0,,,,,,4.803487598896027,5.087353706359863
810,"More challenges also include the environment challenges that are seen over the years .
",0,,,,,,4.212323784828186,5.405215263366699
811,"By the rate of environmental damage , we could see that the lifestyle of a normal human being had to be changed .
",0,,,,,,2.560526490211487,3.0226540565490723
812,"These changes and damages also increase the chances of contacting more illness as we age .
",0,,,,,,4.781599700450897,5.270641326904297
813,"Therefore the challenge is that we need to maintain or improve the state of living is a huge challenge .
",0,,,,,,3.1056127101182938,3.3309743404388428
814,"The ability to eliminate the illness is considered as an achievement as this proves that the ability of the human race to research and develop the medical ability to solve and eliminated the harm that is able to take the life of a human away at a earlier age .
",0,,,,,,2.925326704978943,3.127058982849121
815,"This ability is not seen 40 years back where the technology advances were not as good as now .

816,"All these technology advancement also helps to improve the lives of human race in terms of improving the lifestyle , environment and medical ability .
",0,,,,,,4.2710173381492496,4.277113914489746
817,"Therefore , achieving such great fret , in these areas is considered as an achievement where human lives is then improved and extended the life of us .
",0,,,,,,5.011233150959015,5.837085723876953
818,"Moreover , achieving the near impossible to eliminate all the illness such as cancer and diseases is the greatest achievement for human race .
",0,,,,,,2.97527539730072,3.3276901245117188
819,"This step needs the ability to take a long time of research to make it possible .
",0,,,,,,4.6482586376369,4.687851428985596
820,"Much more could be done to reach the stage of extending the lifespan of human being .
",0,,,,,,2.0848342329263687,2.1416513919830322
821,"In conclusion , we could see that on order to solve the challenges such as the amount of illness that could be growing over the year , the damage to our living environment and stresses that are always building in the city life .
",0,,,,,,3.7081513814628124,3.7660772800445557
822,"There is always a way out where the achievements were done by the humans who used their time to help most people improve our basic needs and life for the living and extension of our life expectancy .
",0,,,,,,3.824007898569107,4.176389694213867
823,"Rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
",0,,,,,,4.16976997628808,4.188906192779541
824,"We should separate it into two aspects .
",1,,,,,,3.5051801204681396,4.705661773681641
825,"The first one is that rising life expectancies can be considered as a challenge .
",0,,,,,,4.070440381765366,4.087459087371826
826,"The second one is that rising life expectancies can also be considered an achievement .
",0,,,,,,3.9984915126115084,4.013968467712402
827,"They are not contradicting with each other .
",0,,,,,,2.4996692091226578,2.5184714794158936
828,"In my opinion , the challenge interception is to make comparison in the cross direction , which is comparing the current situation with the assumed situation .
",0,,,,,,3.587885618209839,4.088954925537109
829,"On the other hand , the achievement perceiving is to make comparison in the wire direction , which is comparing the current situation with the historical situation in the past .
",0,,,,,,2.6022857278585434,2.7471323013305664
830,"So , in the following , I will clarify these two different views for rising life expectancies .
",0,,,,,,4.427405267953873,4.4434404373168945
831,"For the first part , rising life expectancies is a challenge .
",0,,,,,,4.964425079524517,4.996037006378174
832,"We should image that when the life expectancies are raised up ; this will mean that the average age for the population in nation wise or globally is also rising .
",0,,,,,,4.238018903881311,4.2747802734375
833,"The number of the older people will increase to make the average life expectancies higher .
",0,,,,,,4.498326987028122,4.577467441558838
834,"For these older people , the society need man power and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them .
",0,,,,,,3.568807328119874,3.593193531036377
835,"Sometimes , older need more man power and resources than normal young people .
",0,,,,,,2.279951572418213,3.9555251598358154
836,"However , these older people usually contribute less or nearly have no productivity for the society .
",0,,,,,,4.961248755455017,5.552566051483154
837,"We have to say that the older people are becoming a black hole for the entire society in terms of man power and resources .
",0,,,,,,3.2823037267662585,3.2872862815856934
838,"So the dilemma takes place when there are more people who have a higher age .
",0,,,,,,2.1687511205673218,3.3663625717163086
839,"Not only has the family member of the old people , but also the government needed to spend a lot of effort to handle such situation .
",0,,,,,,2.9479467645287514,3.0677218437194824
840,"This is the interpretation of challenge for rising life expectancies .
",0,,,,,,5.999714998528361,6.030785083770752
841,"For the second part , rising life expectancies is also an achievement .
",0,,,,,,4.151065966114402,4.179696559906006
842,"The achievement is some kind of a comparison with the history in the past .
",0,,,,,,2.774342428194359,2.777233362197876
843,"In the ancient time , due to the less development of science and technology , people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care for their healthy .
",0,,,,,,3.411127706989646,3.436112403869629
844,"Hence people died of various diseases .
",0,,,,,,6.353624105453491,7.680952072143555
845,"On the other hand , there are not sufficient materials or ways to improve people 's daily life .
",0,,,,,,3.3800636380910873,3.5249102115631104
846,"People do not know how to protect their tooth from becoming decayed tooth .
",0,,,,,,3.6037507597357035,3.621607780456543
847,"These small things makes the quality of people 's life less enjoyable than today .
",0,,,,,,5.799256384372711,6.21043062210083
848,"Bad mood can not give them a longer time of life .
",0,,,,,,4.3108015060424805,5.900572776794434
849,"Due to all these reasons , people died quite early , which results in a low life expectancy .
",0,,,,,,3.746586889028549,3.816077947616577
850,"So , the mark for how long is the life expectancy is indicating how well people is living .
",0,,,,,,2.5086429119110107,4.008039474487305
851,"In that sense , rising life expectancies can be considered as an achievement .
",1,,,,,,3.497931274585426,3.5116090774536133
852,"From these points , we ourselves should be glad that we can live longer and enjoy a better living environment .
",0,,,,,,2.8570523262023926,3.978018283843994
853,"Besides , we should not forget the responsibility on our shoulder , the older people .
",0,,,,,,2.9752233028411865,4.36500358581543
854,"We should try our best to take care of them as if we are the ones who are old .
",1,,,,,,2.704267840832472,2.728240728378296
855,"In such a situation , the society can develop in a harmonious and healthy way .
",0,,,,,,3.111116568557918,3.1184535026550293
856,"We just take the challenge and enjoy the achievement .
",1,,,,,,4.144431948661804,5.49257755279541
857,"As the world is at the turning point of entering into a stage where people are constantly and notably older than before , how to make life easier , comfortable as well as healthy has been shed light on .
",0,,,,,,4.133904032409191,4.248860836029053
858,"Life expectancy is a figure that reveals the average lifetime and can be used as an indicator to measure up to what degree is the population ageing problem .
",0,,,,,,2.694157123565674,3.1367499828338623
859,"However , there are situations where we have to consider the rising life expectancy as a challenge and an achievement .
",0,,,,,,2.7935256361961365,3.1946961879730225
860,"Rising life expectancy is a challenge in a sense that it is highly relied on development of medication .
",0,,,,,,2.7605428099632263,3.3602097034454346
861,"There are a series of diseases that hinders longevity .
",0,,,,,,3.0141066582873464,3.0252761840820312
862,"Cancers , as a major group of killing diseases , is often beyond current medication to get fully healed .
",0,,,,,,4.5086289048194885,5.2014946937561035
863,"Once cancers are too late to discovered , one is deemed to death at a later stage .
",0,,,,,,2.810244083404541,4.024257183074951
864,"Other diseases such as mental disorder and heart trouble are also top killers , the current medication does have methods to treat the patient , but risks still come along .
",0,,,,,,3.964090005028993,3.96867036819458
865,"Apart from diseases themselves , deficiency of medication system coverage and inefficiency during the treatment process can also restrict to make lifespan longer .
",0,,,,,,5.5191806852817535,5.870782852172852
866,"Patients in many developing and less developed countries , especially African countries , are suffering from simple and easy-to-heal diseases such as cold and flu and probably at the end of the day it becomes the end of their life , albeit they could have been treated well if they were in a country where medication system has been completed and doctors and nurses are standing by to cure these people .
",0,,,,,,2.7693690015003085,2.7735652923583984
867,"To raise life expectancy , one of the questions is how to upgrade the current medication system .
",0,,,,,,3.396522507071495,3.5089011192321777
868,"Government should help encourage the breakthroughs as well as complete medication system .
",0,,,,,,5.0939136147499084,5.655350208282471
869,"Rising life expectancy is also an achievement .
",1,,,,,,3.132436215877533,3.732103109359741
870,"Development of technology is making our life easier and more comfortable .
",0,,,,,,1.5087813138961792,2.6988534927368164
871,"Compared with the world of ancient Rome or China where almost no machines are involved , people nowadays are producing batches and batches of merchandises in factories .
",0,,,,,,3.845601201057434,3.9127697944641113
872,"Machines have replaced a bunch of coolies and heavy labor .
",0,,,,,,5.799698078073561,5.806926727294922
873,"Cars and trucks diminish the redundancy of long time shipment .
",0,,,,,,6.403667986392975,7.100004196166992
874,"As a result , people have more time to enjoy advantage of modern life .
",0,,,,,,2.874009668827057,3.23887300491333
875,"One can easily travel to the other half of the globe to see beautiful scenery that one dreams for his lifetime .
",0,,,,,,3.55905419588089,3.7100346088409424
876,"One can also easily see his deeply loved one through internet from miles away .
",0,,,,,,5.594388917088509,5.761976718902588
877,"More importantly , they can share their ideas of how to keep healthy through Internet , to make more interested people get involve and find ways to make life longer and more wonderful .
",0,,,,,,3.9649919271469116,4.228567123413086
878,"The development of technology brings people joy , making things easier and this may be one of the achievements .
",0,,,,,,5.3030217587947845,5.4473724365234375
879,"In conclusion , it is delighted to observe the fact that life expectancies are rising , but one must have the idea in mind that rising life expectancies is never easy .
",0,,,,,,2.787838938180357,2.790022850036621
880,"There are a series of problems that hinders longevity such as current medication .
",0,,,,,,4.953228858299553,4.964398384094238
881,"But data that shows the rising of life expectancies is indeed an achievement that reveals the improvement of modern life .
",0,,,,,,4.663201067596674,4.711003303527832
882,"As for the future , who knows ?
",1,,,,,,3.966676354408264,4.238436222076416
883,"We are on the right track .
",1,,,,,,2.345402717590332,3.0251669883728027
884,"Probably the next breakthrough is around the corner in the near future .
",1,,,,,,3.630691923201084,3.682025909423828
885,"In recents decedes , it is a trend that people are able to live a longer life .
",1,,,,,,3.9964367244392633,4.024889945983887
886,"This is due to the improvements and breakthroughs in the realm of medication and people 's living condition .
",0,,,,,,4.040027925744653,4.062954425811768
887,"While it is applaudable that people achieved great success in prolonging their lives , there are social challenges posted by the rising life expectancies .
",0,,,,,,3.303822703193873,3.307620048522949
888,"Without a doubt , the rising life expectancy is definitely a success in human history as it shows the achievements of the medical industries in finding out ways and medicines to treat diseases that were thought to be incurable in the past and providing people with vaccines to prevent diseases .
",0,,,,,,2.622420561965555,2.622933864593506
889,"The condition of the living environment is also improved that people are able to live in more hyginenic places .
",0,,,,,,4.117124158889055,4.128684043884277
890,"The improvement in technology also eases people 's lives by replacing all the manual labourous works with easy and simple machine operative works .
",0,,,,,,4.837560983141884,4.841172218322754
891,"Due to the three major factors stated above , people are no longer exposed to disease-breeding living environments , are able to cure their diseases considered fatal last time and do not need to do much labourous work .
",0,,,,,,4.322573632933199,4.331387042999268
892,"The rising life expectancies best prove these improvements and have definitely written a new chapter on the history human civilisation .
",0,,,,,,5.0983869060873985,5.146595001220703
893,"However , as life expectancy rises , some social challenges occurred as well .
",0,,,,,,3.171216130256653,4.124472618103027
894,"As the aging population grows , the young and more energetic people are subject to support more people of old age .
",0,,,,,,4.504443731158972,4.530881881713867
895,"This creates a huge social burden to them and might cause some of them leave the country when the burden becomes unbearable .
",0,,,,,,2.9161547124385834,3.099127769470215
896,"This would result in the lose of manpower in a country .
",0,,,,,,3.7031030356884003,3.740431308746338
897,"Another aspect would be that as the young people feel it is hard to feed the old people in their families and themselves , they would choose not to give birth to any child in order to reduce the burdens on themselves .
",0,,,,,,3.3006167644634843,3.3150107860565186
898,"This would result in decrease in birth rate of a country which is a very serious problem,especially in more developed countries as the population has already reached a minimum .
",0,,,,,,3.009813755750656,3.0471420288085938
899,"Government will be burdened by the growing aging population as well because it needs to set aside a great amount of money to provide better welfare of the old people because they are in urgent need of it .
",0,,,,,,2.7547102575190365,2.760634660720825
900,"Less money will be left to develop the country and explore into new areas of business .
",0,,,,,,3.148873448371887,4.065058708190918
901,"This would result in economic retardation and stagnation of a country .
",1,,,,,,4.001922697760165,4.00439977645874
902,"Afterall , it might seem difficult to handle when the aging population of a country grows , especially the developed countries with very small population .
",0,,,,,,3.4010065495967865,3.6147725582122803
903,"However , when we look at the brighter side of the reality , the rise in life expectancy proves great improvements in various realms and solved many problems we had in the past , there is hope that the aging population may transform into helpful force to a country in the future with the help of better technology and medication .
",0,,,,,,2.6090879514813423,2.6575028896331787
904,"Life expectancy can be defined as desired level of service or better technology to make one 's life more comfortable .
",0,,,,,,4.76170414686203,4.805910110473633
905,"People in current era are described as demanding or having high level of life expectancies in another word .
",0,,,,,,5.370999068021774,5.484855651855469
906,"They are expecting better medication , healthier food , and cleaner environment and so on and so forth .
",0,,,,,,3.7147060185670853,3.834930658340454
907,"However , this rising life expectancies have become a challenge and also and an achievement in the population ageing .
",0,,,,,,4.769572824239731,5.013985633850098
908,"Percentage of elder is increasing annually according to United Nations ' projection .
",0,,,,,,6.400256741791964,6.4122419357299805
909,"In another word , there are more elders who have lower productivity and more medical problems compare to younger people in this world population .
",0,,,,,,3.5034291446208954,3.7774174213409424
910,"On the other hand , people demand better quality of service and advanced technology such as newer I-Pad model .
",0,,,,,,4.3909363597631454,4.408934593200684
911,"In fact , these rising demands require a stronger working force who is active and higher productive than the past .
",0,,,,,,4.757157325744629,5.7090654373168945
912,"However , ageing population is a phenomenon opposite to it .
",0,,,,,,5.2649023830890656,5.743117332458496
913,"Ageing population leads to a working force composed of larger percentage of elders who are lower productivity and thus unable to meet the expectancy .
",0,,,,,,4.876920890063047,4.8878583908081055
914,"The second life expectancy is increased medical technology and sources .
",0,,,,,,4.122695446014404,6.033472061157227
915,"Ageing population requires more medical sources since elders needs more medical attention .
",0,,,,,,5.432273030281067,7.0424299240112305
916,"However , the health level of world population shows an increasing trend due to advancing medical technology and it leads to exponential growth in number of elders worldwide .
",0,,,,,,3.3938648775219917,3.417407512664795
917,"Nevertheless , provision of more medicine and better equipments as well as more medical centre is necessary to accommodate these elders .
",0,,,,,,3.420974478125572,3.4375293254852295
918,"Another rising life expectancy is a bigger house with a lower price which is raised up by younger generation .
",0,,,,,,3.777745008468628,4.889808654785156
919,"Ageing population is a consequence of increasing health level of population .
",0,,,,,,3.7246559634804726,3.7980458736419678
920,"The concurrent result is increasing size of population .
",0,,,,,,5.930802404880524,6.793617248535156
921,"When the elders live longer , the family size actually increases rather than decreases .

949,"The second challenge will be the shortage of natural resources .
",1,,,,,,4.278937958180904,4.311309814453125
950,"As we know that population of human continues in growth year by year , we are using the non-recoverable natural resources in everyday life , for example , the oil , people 's life and technology improvement are not able to continue without the usage of oil .

",1,,,,,,3.984474189579487,4.0513763427734375
1064,"Due the rise of the life span and the shrink of the birth rate , the portion of the elderly portion is larger and larger .
",0,,,,,,3.521371968090534,3.5630836486816406

",0,,,,,,2.64973483979702,2.794581413269043
1071,"Maybe , it is because the modern society is become more and more competitive , the parents are paying much attention and importance to their career .

",1,,,,,,3.607731442898512,3.649045944213867

",0,,,,,,2.565293073654175,3.1118202209472656

",1,,,,,,3.5858176946640015,4.588267803192139
1078,"The issue facing us is more challenging and tricky .
",1,,,,,,5.704785346984863,6.73420524597168
1079,"First , if the older people increase , there will be fewer workforces that can support the society .
",0,,,,,,4.656109839677811,4.80116605758667
1080,"However , ageing population will also increase many kinds of other expenditure .
",0,,,,,,5.646818719804287,5.66091775894165
1081,"The most important part is health care and old-age pension .
",0,,,,,,2.9532118709757924,2.968261241912842
1082,"As elderly people , they need more money for health care than the younger .
",0,,,,,,2.6103042364120483,2.928864002227783
1083,"Government should also make a bigger amount of pension expenditure .
",0,,,,,,4.979007117450237,5.063852310180664
1084,"Secondly , for the older people , more facilities and service for them should be provided .
",0,,,,,,3.1681539937853813,3.2786436080932617
1085,"So more manpower will be employed , which deduces the labour in other area .
",0,,,,,,4.289691686630249,5.129904270172119
1086,"Of course , more money will be spent .
",1,,,,,,2.1739320158958435,2.5558676719665527
1087,"To pay this extra money , government will exert higher taxed on the other people .
",0,,,,,,3.9230233430862427,5.419933319091797
1088,"Thirdly , compared to the young people , the security of the elderly is more notable .
",0,,,,,,2.607561767101288,3.16581130027771
1089,"Elderly people 's ability to move and act is much lower .
",1,,,,,,4.088115084916353,4.112914085388184

",1,,,,,,4.35087925195694,4.884851455688477

",0,,,,,,3.3714812994003296,3.768042802810669
1092,"To conclude , the population ageing phenomenon indeed shows our big achievement on economy , medical skills and living standard .
",0,,,,,,5.829970121383667,7.113784313201904
1093,"Nonetheless , the issues it brings out are more worthy to be considered .
",1,,,,,,3.350691258907318,4.257228374481201
1094,"More elderly people will bring a big extra burden to the society and government .
",0,,,,,,2.974433720111847,3.473130941390991
1095,"More facilities and service will be needed to fulfill these requirements .
",1,,,,,,3.1376118659973145,3.5218167304992676

",1,,,,,,2.7694777864962816,2.7940075397491455

",1,,,,,,3.902628481388092,4.073288440704346
1294,"Following are the more specific explanations .
",0,,,,,,4.189975380897522,5.702057361602783
1295,"The rising average life expectancies can surely cause some problems .
",0,,,,,,5.520579196512699,5.555456161499023
1296,"Firstly , the aging population is generally of low productivity .
",1,,,,,,3.362404465675354,4.757494926452637
1297,"It is a natural rule that when people grow older , their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower , so they will contribute less to the society .
",0,,,,,,2.633320599794388,2.9390170574188232
1298,"In addition , elderly people are using same or even more amount of social resource , as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status .
",0,,,,,,4.483789473772049,4.570275783538818
1299,"Furthermore , to make livings , many senior citizens go back to work field .
",0,,,,,,5.05577826499939,5.288407325744629
1300,"It will also induce many problems .
",1,,,,,,2.553511619567871,5.079250812530518
1301,"For example , these senior citizens may do the work less efficient and which will lead to a low effective output .
",0,,,,,,3.839012961834669,3.889918565750122
1302,"To make him or her more competitive so that not be beat by the younger , old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus .
",0,,,,,,5.649993441998959,5.737908363342285
1303,"This may lead to the younger 's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standard to reduce the daily cost .
",0,,,,,,4.064485609531403,4.412861347198486
1304,"Besides , the elderly with less salary also have to lower their living standard ; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in to a less stable situation .
",0,,,,,,4.085934400558472,4.326350688934326
1305,"There are also some older people live a rich life with their deposits and retirement compensation .
",0,,,,,,3.4949918389320374,4.343460559844971
1306,"They can live a happy life , but actually to the society as a whole , it is a waste of social resource .
",0,,,,,,3.5185357201844454,3.528186321258545
1307,"Also , the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may become a resistance of the positive social change .
",0,,,,,,4.577173877507448,4.59506368637085
1308,"Above all , the population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of a society .
",0,,,,,,3.5290284575894475,3.5444092750549316
1309,"However , the growing life expectancies also mean an achievement to the human society .
",0,,,,,,5.637673145160079,5.668674468994141
1310,"Actually , living a longer life needs a lot of conditions to realize .
",1,,,,,,5.006269454956055,5.357978820800781
1311,"There are many factors which will result in the death of people , such as natural disasters , accident , diseases or suicides .
",1,,,,,,2.926939283963293,2.933772563934326
1312,"Long life span for the individual himself is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face the life full of problems .
",0,,,,,,3.52873030025512,3.5432229042053223

",0,,,,,,3.784966628998518,3.8009729385375977
